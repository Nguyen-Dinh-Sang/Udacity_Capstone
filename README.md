# Udacity Capstone Project

Hi Udacity's mentor.
I'm Sang. 
This is my capstone project. I chose the Serverless approach and reused the project in course 4 that I completed earlier.

## Implement new feature:
* Keep user's session after refesh browser using local storage.
* I update the UI to make it more beautiful.
* Download attachment.
* Remove attachment.
* Delete attachment when delete Todo.
* After you upload the attachment I will get back to the home page auto.

Thank you for reading, mentor.
